CredPal Mobile Application Developer Assessment

Overview
This repository contains the implementation for the CredPal Mobile Application Developer Assessment. The objective of this assessment is to replicate the UI design provided in the Figma link using React Native, which is expected to work on iOS and Android platforms.

Instructions
The task was to implement the provided UI design from the Figma link: [Figma Design Link](https://www.figma.com/file/KZKDiLKAnm04rPAKMx350o/Untitled?node-id=0%3A1&t=XHNQBxPrmi0NBVSu-1).

Though the task originally specified the use of Flutter, I have used **React Native** to implement the UI. The app should be functional on both Android and iOS devices, and I have made every effort to replicate the design as closely as possible. I have also made assumptions in areas where interaction or scroll behavior wasn't clearly represented.

Deliverables

1. A GitHub repository with progressively committed code.
2. A zip file containing the output of the implementation, either a web release folder or an APK file.
3. Screenshots of the finished product.
4. Instructions to run the code along with any assumptions made during the implementation.

How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   bash
   git clone https://github.com/acrodney/credpal.git
   cd credpal

2. Install dependencies:
   bash
   npm install

3. Start the development server:
   bash
   npm start

   or for Expo:

   bash
   expo start

4. Run the app on an iOS or Android emulator, or on a physical device using Expo Go.

Assumptions Made

- I have made several assumptions regarding scroll behavior and interaction that were not explicitly stated in the design.
- The app is designed to be responsive and adapt to different screen sizes.
- Minor variations in UI elements might exist due to React Native's component limitations.

Screenshots
Screenshots of the app can be found in the `screenshots` folder of the repository.

Conclusion
This is a basic UI replication exercise to demonstrate my skills in implementing mobile interfaces. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions regarding the implementation.

This project was built with React Native.
